Ever since I was a kid I have been using data analytics without even knowing it, such as when I checked how many views I got on my youtube channel when I was eleven or when I am watching basketball and keeping an eye out on statistics of certain players. Point is, I have discovered that analyzing data and making interpretations or drawing conclusions is something I feel passionately about. I am currently taking stats 263, which has been my favourite class so far this semester and I plan on taking more statistic courses in my upper years. The reason I would like to be a general member is so that I can expand my network and build something hands on with my peers. I enjoy helping people and finding ways to make everyday tasks easier. Moreover, I feel like I can leverage off of the upper year students who have a lot of experience with algorithms and ways we can use data.

My role as a code ninjas tutor has allowed me to develop strong teaching and mentorship skills. Teaching kids how to code requires patience, clear communication, and the ability to break down complex concepts into understandable parts. Additionally, I have been put through countless scenarios where I adapt my teaching style to cater towards kids with disabilities, kids on spectrum etc. During my time here, I have worked with many co - workers to implement new systems and ensure they progress through their learning journey. This can be used in a team setting as I am able to effectively communicate my ideas and contribute to the group setting while wanting to learn and view progress. Another experience that has shaped me into my current character is playing many different types of sports growing up, but in specific my prep basketball team. This was a time in my life where I was training for over 10 hours a week and built skills such as work ethic, determination and time management skills. Not to mention the skills I learned on the court such as leadership, communication and teamwork. Players must work together cohesively to achieve common goals, similar to how teams in  professional settings need to collaborate effectively to make progress in their projects.

In this role, I had to collaborate and coordinate with all the other clubs and faculties around the school to endure that all of our students could feel represented in the yearbook. Additionally, I had to plan and overlook  the layout and final designs before it went to out publishing company. This position taught me effective communication and coordination. It also taught me unique problem solving skills. One time, right before our final deadline, our team noticed that one of the graduates were in the wrong spot (graduates were listed alphabetically). To make these changes, we had to restart 7 pages of the yearbook, and many of the members that worked on the grad pages were not present that day. So, I collected a small group of 4 students and taught them how to use the photoshop software template and delegated pages. In under 2 hours, our team managed to complete all the pages with room to double check the pages before we submitted them!

First is that I love problem solving; I picked my major as computer science solely off the fact I took a course in high school for it and realized how fast the hours go by when I'm trying to find a solution in my own way for a uniquely given problem. During this same time, I actually got really interested in data science as a whole due to a class project where we had to pick a career somewhat related to computing, where I looked into actuarial science. I'm planning on taking a minor in statistics because it is the field of math that is by far the most interesting to me and has an infinite amount of applications in real life. Data and data analytics takes both of these and combines them into using data and statistics to hopefully solve real problems. So seeing that a club encompassed not only one, but two topics that I've been wanting to pursue, I really would like to join. Not only that, but working together with others to solve problems and building off of others ideas is what I think can fuel myself and those around me to push our boundaries and I think this is a great atmosphere to do exactly that.","I have some high school level experience of programming, although not completely useful for complex problems, I think it can provide a new perspective. I also competitively ski raced most of my life and all of which was done in a team setting where we would help each other improve and be our best selves.

I also tutored several peers throughout high school, one-on-one and in a group, where I learned concepts even better by teaching it to others. As a kid I participated in a robotics team for a couple of years, which was a very similar environment to this, where we were given a task to prep for a few months before a competition. I am a really good team member and I'm not afraid to ask questions, learn from, or help teach my peers.",,"I keep track of due dates and lectures at least a week ahead of time and plan any of my plans around those.

- Online student community lead tutor for A-level (UK Based Exam Board for High School) 
  involving Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics – a server with 20,000+ 
  international students.  

In terms of skills required to be incorporated into student clubs, I have achieved the following post covid (2021): 

- Achieved certification from world renowned public speaking organization, Toastmasters, 
  for completing 10 speeches across national competitions in Qatar.  
- STEM Club participation certificate for research involving DNS (Domain Name System) and 
  interconnectivity of computer systems.  
- Digital Marketing club in the British School of Milan, coming up with ideas to propose to 
  potential investors and startup founders. My idea revolved around using augmented reality 
  to enable people to see how clothes they think of buying will look on them before the 
  purchase, based on their body metrics and measurements given.  

All these major positions in different countries around the world prepared me for any culture shock I would face in the future and eased my transition to any place, regardless of the location and the people around me.  
These experiences in different parts of the world only serve to highlight my willingness to put in the effort necessary to have an influence. I'm eager to learn more about data analytics principles and use them in practical settings. ",,"I've always been a very organized person who enjoyed finishing stuff as soon as I received it. By developing these habits, I was able to ensure that I was constantly on top of my work, spending less time on assigned problems and more time practicing other types of questions and developing very good conceptual understanding.  I am certain that adding the workload from QDAA to my current schedule won't significantly change things and certainly won't have a bad effect.   In the extremely unlikely event that I have too much work, I will catch up with my group. This will aid the team by improving teamwork and allowing us to get to know one another better.

I don't have a lot of other commitments to attend to (yet) so it should be easy.
10/1/2023 14:15:54,Michael Jin,22vl26@queensu.ca,Computer Science,1st,"There are several reasons why I am eager to become a member of QDAA. Firstly, I am fascinated by Data Analytics, as analyzing data with a computer is the future, and I would love to learn more about it. Such knowledge will greatly benefit me in the future. Secondly, the real-world projects I would get to work on as part of QDAA, as well as collaborating with team members, are highly appealing. Being a general member of QDAA will give me the opportunity to work on real-life projects and acquire useful technical and communication skills that I might not have the chance to learn on my own or in a classroom setting. Thirdly, the networking opportunities that QDAA provides are invaluable. Having the chance to network with recruiters and professionals will allow me to meet new people and possibly secure an internship. Finally, the comprehensive classes that QDAA offers are very interesting. Looking at the description of the classes that a general member gets to attend really excites me. I am interested in most of the topics, and I would love to learn alongside a group of like-minded individuals in the club.","I believe that I have many experiences that I can bring to the table to enrich the team. Some of my past experiences from high school have significantly shaped my leadership, organizational, and communication skills, which I believe are highly valuable in a team environment. An example of this is when I worked in a team during my grade 12 innovative project called Zero Hunger in the community. Through this experience, I gained valuable insights into the dynamics of effective teamwork, which I can apply to being a part of QDAA. I came to appreciate the diverse perspectives and ideas that each team member brought to the table. It was evident that our combined efforts propelled us toward success, and this will be relevant to the projects I will work on as a part of QDAA. Our event was incredibly successful, as we managed to engage the entire school, resulting in the generous donation of four boxes of food and over $250. These contributions were channeled directly to the Daily Bread Food Bank, making a significant difference in the lives of those in need in our neighbourhood.

This experience demonstrated to me how working together with others can lead to great success, as everyone brings their own unique ideas to light. It has made me even more determined to continue collaborating with others to create outstanding projects",,"There are several measures I will take to balance being a general member and a busy student. Firstly, I will prioritize and set goals, identifying my top priorities, whether it's the club environment or school. This will help me allocate my time and energy effectively. Secondly, I will create a schedule. I will use a planner or a digital calendar to schedule my classes, study sessions, and club meetings/events. I will make sure to allocate specific time blocks for each activity. Thirdly, I will communicate with Club Members. I will let my club members know about my schedule and any potential conflicts. They may be able to accommodate my availability or provide alternative ways for me to contribute. Lastly, I will set realistic expectations and understand that I won't be able to attend every meeting or event. I will be honest with myself and my club about my availability."

First and foremost, this opportunity offers me invaluable hands-on learning experiences in data analytics and problem-solving. Working on real-world projects with peers in a collaborative environment is the perfect complement to my theoretical coursework.

QDAA's comprehensive classes in AI, Data Science, Software Engineering, and more align perfectly with my academic interests. I'm excited to enhance my skillset in these high-demand fields, and I appreciate that no prior experience is required. This inclusive approach ensures that I can learn and grow alongside supportive teammates.

Networking opportunities are another key draw. Connecting with recruiters, professionals, and alumni through QDAA's events can pave the way for internships and future career opportunities. Additionally, the mentorship provided by QDAA Product Managers is invaluable for navigating challenges and ensuring my success.

However what excites me most is the chance to work on projects that address pressing real-world challenges. This means my contributions will have a tangible impact, which is incredibly motivating. Overall, joining QDAA aligns perfectly with my academic pursuits and career aspirations, and I'm eager to start this journey of learning, collaboration, and making a meaningful difference.","I bring a diverse set of experiences and skills that can greatly enrich the QDAA team. As a former member of the engineering club in high school, I honed my problem-solving abilities and learned to work effectively in collaborative environments. Serving as co-president of the investment club strengthened my leadership and communication skills, which are crucial for successful teamwork and project management.

One of my notable achievements is building a website dedicated to teaching individuals the basics of Java programming. This project not only showcased my technical proficiency but also my ability to break down complex concepts into understandable content. It demonstrates my commitment to knowledge sharing and helping others learn.

In addition to these experiences, I possess strong soft skills. My adaptability and quick learning ability ensure that I can readily acquire new skills and adapt to the evolving demands of data analytics projects. Effective communication and active listening are skills I've honed through leadership roles and collaboration with diverse groups of individuals.

Furthermore, my passion for data analytics and commitment to making a meaningful impact align seamlessly with QDAA's mission. I am excited to contribute my unique blend of technical expertise, leadership, and communication skills to the team's efforts in tackling real-world challenges through data analytics. Together, we can create innovative solutions and drive positive change.","I got to know about Queen's Data Analytics Association through meeting the Co-Chair Vinicius during a club fair. I have met him several times and would love to have the opportunity to work with him as a new member of this club. 

However I understand that given he is the co-chair and already has a lot of responsibilities, this may not be possible. If this happens to be the case, I would like to be paired with a team member in the software engineering or data analytics department.","Balancing my role as a QDAA General Member with my student life is a priority. Given that I will have to commit to only 2 hours a week, this should be fairly manageable. I'll make sure to set aside time for QDAA work without letting it interfere with my classes and studies. If any issues come up, I'll talk to my QDAA team and adjust my schedule as needed. Keeping things flexible and communicating well will help me contribute to QDAA while managing my academic responsibilities effectively."
10/1/2023 18:45:56,George Wu,22hkb@queensu.ca,Computing,1st,"I'm looking to be a QDAA general member for a couple reasons. First, I'm hoping to meet upper years and surround myself with smart, like-minded people who want to go above and beyond just schoolwork. There's too much I want to learn, I just need to take on the rught opportunities. More importantly, I also really want to learn more about data analytics - it's one of the options I want to pursue in the future under computing, but I have no clue what work or a career in it actually entails. Lastly, I want actual experience working on a project. Too much of university is theoretical knowledge that can never be applied, but QDAA could give me applicable and transferable skills to the real world.","I've participated in hackathons, including HackTheNorth 2021. This has allowed me to pick up a strong work ethic under time pressure. It's also helped my collaboration skills, like listening to others and bouncing ideas off of friends.

When I played badminton competitively, I also used to coach younger kids. This has developed my leadership skills, like uplifting a team's morale and public speaking.

When it comes to hard skills, I've worked on a lot of small CS-related projects (mostly through school or hackathons) that have given me basic understanding of HTML/CSS, Javascript, Java, C++, Unity (C#), and Python (Most of these languages are rusty, though). C++ is currently my strongest language, but that will probably become Python by the end of the year due to CISC 121 and 124. I also have experience with graphic design, as I currently help create social media posts for a Canadian registered nonprofit.",,"It all comes down to focusing on my own well-being. As long as I can sleep, eat, and maintain consistency during my day-to-day life, I hardly burn out and can keep on top of my work. I do this by having a daily, and weekly schedule for the work I need to complete.

I've gotten pretty good at minimizing procrastination as well, by studying in the library with friends. I can always ask them for help on something if I need help, and I'm deterred away from being on my phone by seeing everyone else studying hard.

Finally, I'm only looking for one club commitment this year. I don't want to spread myself too thin, and QDAA seems perfect since as mentioned prior, data analytics is the option I'm hoping to pursue in the second year of computing."

In 7th grade, I dove into the world of computer science and programming further, and I discovered how much fun it was. I enjoy the challenging and rewarding process of problem solving with code. As I’ve gotten older, concepts such as AI and data science have stood out to me in particular because of how many potential applications these focuses can have. For example, I’ve always been fascinated by Nvidia’s DLSS system of image enhancement. It is effectively able to increase the frame per second rendered by, and subsequently enhance a computer’s performance, all as a result of intense data analysis of images. The Queen’s Data Analytics Association in particular stood out to me because of the real-world projects that members get to work on. Being able to learn many new computer and data science concepts is so interesting, and being able to apply the things I learn in a team setting will allow me to grow so many important skills to make a positive difference to this club and beyond.","While I haven’t worked on data science specific projects before, I have worked with a variety of programming languages. I know the basics of Python, Java, and C++, both with functional and Object-Oriented programming styles. Although not programming languages, I have also completed courses about and have worked with HTML and CSS, in case any projects we work on need a front end. Additionally, I have a passion for math, and a willingness to learn a variety of new skills in order to complete our project. Aside from computer science skills, I have a variety of interpersonal skills that are very important in a team setting. I have grown my communication, quick thinking, and problem solving skills from my time in my high school’s Model United Nations club, where I debated as a general member for one year, and was president of the club for two years. Additionally, I learned leadership and organizational skills from my time as an executive in our school’s Prefect organization, which is an organization of around 200 people responsible for student life and events. All of these skills will be important when working with a group of people who may not always have the same ideas, schedules, or workflows.",,"I have always participated in a variety of extracurricular activities including being on the Cross-Country Team, participating in Rep-Level Soccer, being an Executive Member in my school’s Prefect Organization, being President of the Model United Nations Club, competing in various math and coding competitions, being a Mental-Health Champion in my school board, and much more. All of these things had to be balanced with being a student, and while the workload in university is more than it is in highschool, I know I have the time management skills to be able to commit to the Queen’s Data Analytics Association."

Since I have learned how to code I have only made miniscule projects that stay on my computer. I have gotten to the point where I need to start building real projects to feel fulfilled. I am also extremely passionate about data analytics, something about working with numbers, trying to understand what they mean, and using them to optimize business has always been something I wanted to do. Working with and managing data has always been my strong suit since I was a child, so applying it now would be like a dream come true. As someone who has been positively affected by good data analytics after being diagnosed with Crohn's disease and picking the best treatment for me, I began to understood how truly important it is, and I wanted to be a part of making other people's lives better. ","In terms of coding, I taught myself Python four years ago and learned Java two years ago, in that time I have created little projects on my computer. I can apply those years of coding experience to aid my teammates with the technical aspects of QDAA. I have also been working as a part of a retail team for the past two years. During this time, I learned the importance of actively listening to everyone and taking their opinions seriously. In these two years, I have learned to become the ultimate team player, I had to deal with conflicts between people, but more importantly, I learned how to play a role that can optimize my team's performance. This mindset was contagious, leading to the creation of a highly effective sales team. Finally, I believe my experience in the entrepreneurship stream of DECA can help the development of new project ideas within the team. QDAA is so much more than simply being able to write code and gather data, my DECA experience can not only help a team develop great innovative ideas but analyze the data in new creative ways as well.

The workshops and lessons I will learn in this club will help me to deepen my understanding of how to manipulate data to find patterns in different databases, such as those I deal with for my economics classes. I acknowledge that data analytics can be used for a wide range of other disciplines, and I am eager to learn how these data analytical skills can be applied to solve problems in these other disciplines! One of my first coding projects involved using SQL to get specific information about movies and actors from IMDB! This project showed me the potential for using SQL and other languages to gain insights when examining databases. 

In addition, working in a team will allow me to develop friendships with other students with differing perspectives and work methods. I value working in a team as it will lead to learning and provide a supportive environment where I can receive frequent feedback.","I volunteered as a maths tutor for Community Living Kingston and District for three years. As a tutor, I was responsible for teaching fundamental maths concepts to a high school student with intellectual disabilities. During my meetings, I had to ensure that I was articulating my ideas clearly.  I also had to listen attentively to my tutee's concerns and modify my lessons and teaching style according to my tutee's learning requirements. My strong communication skills will be an asset when collaborating with my peers on the group project.

As a fourth-year computer science student, I have developed quantitative and technical skills through my courses and group projects. Accordingly, my courses from Queen’s and the University of Edinburgh (where I completed my exchange) have taught me how to think about problems logically, and how to solve these problems by choosing the most efficient algorithm.  I have since been able to help other students learn how to solve problems concisely and efficiently by TAing CISC 124’s “Introduction to Computer Science II.”

In addition to my core computer science courses, I have taken economics courses, ranging from “Environmental Economics” to “Programming for Economics”. This level of exposure to other disciplines has taught me about ways to address economic frictions and productivity levels. The research I have completed in these Economics courses have made me curious to learn how we can use programming languages, algorithms, and computing principles to analyse such problems!",,"Throughout my university experience, I have developed organisational practices so that I can balance my academic and extracurricular activities. Some of theses practices involve 
Prioritising my tasks by evaluating the urgency and importance of each task, and then allocating my task according to these two factors.
Studying in quiet areas, and taking 10-minute breaks every 50-60 minutes. These short breaks help to avoid “pseudo studying.”
Creating a daily schedule, and updating my monthly calendar. These practices give me a general view of the number of tasks I can accomplish in a given day. It also allows me to schedule time for my extracurriculars and hobbies, such as running and hiking!

I am eager to further develop these skills in a collaborative and supportive environment, and I see the QDAA as the perfect platform to do so.  Moreover, I am enthusiastic about the prospect of contributing to the club's initiatives. Whether it's through participating in group projects, or sharing insights from my own experiences, I am committed to adding value to the community.  I am also looking forward to networking with fellow members who share a passion for data analysis. I believe that the diverse perspectives within the club can lead to enriching discussions and opportunities for mutual growth.","I have a good experience in coding in many programming languages, such as Python, Java, C, Bash, Matlab, Prolog. In the past, I have also taken CISC271, linear data analytics. In this course at Queen's I learned about numerous algorithms related to data analytics for example dimensionality reduction, linear regression, etc. I have worked at Tim Hortons before where I learned many other life skills such as time management, team building, becoming fast learner, and overall communication. ","Yash Elias, Ben Braun","I will make it a priority to strike a balance between my responsibilities as a general member and the demands of my demanding academic schedule. I want to effectively manage my time by using tools like calendars and to-do lists, making sure to set aside particular times for both my academic goals and my responsibilities as a general member. This will help me to prepare ahead and avoid problems. "
